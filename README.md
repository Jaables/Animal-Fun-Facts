# Animal-Fun-Facts
A project that displays random animal facts when clicked on, built using React.

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-stack course to practice using React to build interactive websites. We were given animals.js, index.html & styles.css. I wrote the code within the app.js file.

Below is the project discription: 

"Our program will display a selection of animals on the screen. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, weâ€™ll be able to see different facts."
